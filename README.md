# SECURE NOTES

## Description
Secure Notes is a web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) to securely manage and store notes. It provides users with a platform to create, edit, and delete notes while ensuring their data remains encrypted and protected.

## Features
- User Authentication: Secure Notes requires users to sign up and log in to access their notes, ensuring data privacy and security.
- Note Management: Users can create, edit, and delete notes, enabling efficient organization and management of their information.
- Encryption: Notes are encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms to safeguard sensitive data from unauthorized access.
- Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive, providing a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store user information and encrypted notes.
- Express.js: A Node.js framework used for building the server-side application and RESTful APIs.
- React.js: A JavaScript library used for building the user interface and interactive components.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment used for server-side scripting and executing JavaScript code.
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Used for user authentication and authorization.
- bcrypt.js: Used for password hashing to enhance security.
- Bootstrap: A front-end framework used for responsive and mobile-first web development.
